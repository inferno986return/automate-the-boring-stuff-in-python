<p class="noindent">It&#8217;s misleading to have just my name on the cover. I couldn&#8217;t have written a book like this without the help of a lot of people. I&#8217;d like to thank my publisher, Bill Pollock; my editors, Laurel Chun, Leslie Shen, Greg Poulos, Jennifer Griffith-Delgado, and Frances Saux; and the rest of the staff at No Starch Press for their invaluable help. Thanks to my tech reviewers, Ari Lacenski and Philip James, for great suggestions, edits, and support.</p>
<p class="indent">Many thanks to everyone at the Python Software Foundation for their great work. The Python community is the best one I&#8217;ve found in the tech industry.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, I would like to thank my family, friends, and the gang at Shotwell&#8217;s for not minding the busy life I&#8217;ve had while writing this book. Cheers!<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxvi"/></p>
